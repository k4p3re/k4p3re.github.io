>The Security Analyst 2 preliminary CTF was a pretty easy and straight forward CTF that consisted of Multipe Choice Questions (MCQ), Pentest, Wireless security, Forensics and Crypto challenges.
>To start with were the MCQs and the solutions are displayed on the below screenshots;

>That was pretty simple to answer, right?ðŸ¥³ðŸ˜‚

>Now lets go to the interesting bit of the CTF, the pentest task.
>Upon getting the machine IP address, my first task was to do an nmap scan.

## Reconnaisance
```

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 74.41 seconds


```
>The scan gives us 3 ports, 2 open and 1 closed.Further enumeration on the given web to find content that has not been indexed i.e say the robots.txt file

>On the browser: http://MACHINE_IP/robots.txt

>In the `robots.txt` we discover very interesting files. The `fsocity.dic` which from my guess is a dictionary file. As well we find our first key. Very impressive huuh!!

>Directory enumeration has given very juicy information that guides me to the next step. From this I discovered a wordpress site with a login page at `/wp-admin`.


Definitely what comes to my mind is do a bruteforce attack to discover username and password since we have a custom wordlist for it.

For this task i decide to use hydra for bruteforcing.
```
hydra -L fsocity.dic -p test MACHINE_IP http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PWD^:Invalid username" -t 30
```


>This hydra command gives us the username and the next thing i needed was a password to be able to gain access to the wordpress site. So I did another hydra bruteforce to get the password.

```
hydra -l Elliot -P fsocity.dic MACHINE_IP http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PWD^:The password you entered for the username" -t 30
```

> Using the username and password I obtained from the bruteforce, I gained access to the site and looking through I could see the logged in user has the privileges of editing the site and this was an amazing discovery. Having editor privileges means as an attacker I can launch a reverse shell. Interesting one here.
> I searched on the web for a php revshell script since the site has `.php` extension templates. I love visiting the pentestmonkey site for rev shell scripts 

I abused the editor privileges to get a reverse shell to that machine. I executed the php revshell on the site as I listen on my attacker machine.

Yes we got our shell. Lets make the shell stable
```
python -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
daemon@linux:/$ 

```
>When I navigated to the `/home/robot` directory I found the second key and an MD5 password hash. This gives us a hint  that to read the key, I needed a password which might be contained in the password hash. I used john to try  crack the password hash.

```
john md5.hash --wordlist=fsocity.dic --format=Raw-MD5
```

>I got the password and I was able to read the second key.
## Privilege Escalation 
>In privilege escalation, I tried several tricks but couldn't really work until I attempted to find some SUID binaries

```
find / -perm +6000 2>/dev/null | grep '/bin'
```
>I quickly spotted the nmap binary SUID. Went to GTFOBins to find its exploit
>On the terminal, I used this exploit for nmpa suid binary to have my way in as `root`

```
nmap --interactive

!sh
```

## Crypto
Crypto challenge was a walk in the park for me..finished within few minutesðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

### Questions

Bob sent alice a message could you get what bob wanted alice to apply to : "Hello Alice apply to this asap
-.-. -.-- -... . .-. ... .... ..- .--- .- .-"

With this straight away i knew it's morsecode looking at the hyphens and dots. Found an online translator tool and got the hidden message.
```
cybershujaa
```


The undercover agent sent a message just before the whole country experienced a power outage, Can you decrypt the message and see what the agent wanted to say ? message : 9 444 66 8 33 444 7777 8 44 33 222 88 555 7 777 444 8

This took some research, then i landed on a cipher known as SMS Phone Tab Code Cipher(Mulptitap mode). Decoded it using an online tool and got the answer.

```
winteistheculprit
```
 Just another kind of  Ceaser, decrypt => ireelrnflpunyyratr 
 This was the final challenge and got very easy as well. Online decoder and boom you got your flag.
